# Welcome to Bytessay's markdown-check

This is a markdown format checker written in rust.

> [!NOTE]
> The main reason for developing this project is because the author uses markdown as the blog content format, and needs to have some of the necessary fields to complete the blog construction. So I developed a markdown format checker.

## Features

- [x] Basic frontmatter format checking :tada:
